## Course Overview

In previous courses, you have examined how to write programs in individual languages such as Java or C.
In this class, we will take a broader view of programming languages, and study the key
concepts and techniques that allow developers to *implement* languages such as Java or C.
This will be a project-based course, and we will develop significant experience in this area,
by learning how to use *functional programming* (specifically the OCaml language) to build
(over the course of the semester) a working interpreter for a non-trivial subset of JavaScript.
Ultimately, the course will improve your skill as a programmer, and will deepen your understanding
of how programming languages are designed and implemented.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are [CSCI-306 Software Engineering](http://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci306/index.html) and [CSCI-358 Discrete Math](http://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci358/index.html). As long as you have some programming experience and basic mathematical knowledge, that should be sufficient.

## WARNING

This is a **difficult** class, for several reasons:
1. We will take a **formal** approach to the topics, i.e., we will carefully develop the mathematical/logical underpinnings of programming languages design and implementation. You may not have seen this level of formality in any other CS class so far.
2. The class is **project-based**, meaning you should expect to devote a significant portion of your effort for this class towards writing code.
3. Virtually all of the code you write will be in a **functional programming language** like OCaml. This may be your first exposure to functional programming.
4. Programming languages textbooks are often highly technical. We have tried to collect some of the most easily-digestible materials for your reference, but you may find it difficult to master the material without being actively engaged in the class. Class **attendance and participation are essential**.

## Online Community and Communication

**In Homework 1, you will be asked to introduce yourself to the instructor. This includes sending
a passport-style photo of yourself to the instructor.
The photo must be clear, with your face un-obstructed.**
If you are not comfortable providing a photo, then you will need to contact the instructor to set up
a brief Zoom meeting to introduce yourself.
Failure to meet this requirement on Homework 1 will result in a 0 (zero) for the Participation component
of the grade.

We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) in the class.
This is a great way to ask questions and communicate with the instructor
and your classmates. Participation on Piazza is **required**,
and will factor into the Participation component of the grade.

The class Piazza link is: https://piazza.com/mines/fall2021/csci400/home

The instructors will use Piazza to communicate with the class. If you have
questions about the course, you should first do a quick search on the Piazza page,
to make sure your question has not already been answered there. If not, please
go ahead and post your question on Piazza so that the instructor, the TA, or another student
can answer it publicly. This will help to streamline the communication.

NOTE #1: **neither the instructors nor the TAs will debug your code for you!** If you are
having difficulty with a certain piece of code, take the time to identify what specific
operation(s) is causing unexpected behavior, and ask for help about that. In other words,
posting/emailing your source code is not allowed, but asking questions about language
features or generic code snippets is welcomed.

NOTE #2: if you have a question you do not wish to publicize (e.g., about your
grades, etc.), please create a "private post" on Piazza. **Email should only
be used in rare instances where use of Piazza would not be feasible.**

## Textbook and Other Reading Materials

NOTE: the following resources are *recommended*, but **NOT REQUIRED**. I will assign
readings from these sources to supplement the lectures, but you are only responsible
for the information presented in lecture.

- [*Functional Programming in OCaml* by Clarkson et al.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/textbook/)
- [*The Semantics of Programming Languages* by Matthew Hennessy](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ksp8kjp7orn3s4/kspod4vo1g21ol)

The above links will take you to free versions of the materials.

## Class Notes

Class notes will be posted 1-2 days after the lecture.
**Posted notes are not guaranteed to provide all information discussed in lecture**
(class attendance is highly recommended).

There is a Github organization for the class:
[https://github.com/mines-csci400](https://github.com/mines-csci400)
All of your individual/team repositories will show up there.

## Grading

The following percentages show how final grades will be calculated.
I will *not* perform any rounding on the scores (e.g., a score of 92.999 will not be rounded up to 93).
I may or may not curve the overall
grades, depending on how well the class performs overall, however, *I expect each student to
work hard, and not rely on the curve!*

Many of us are facing exceptional difficulties due to the pandemic, etc.,
so I am starting everyone's overall grade at 56%. If your goal is to pass the class, that
should be attainable with minimal effort. If your goal is to obtain an "A", you will
still need to take the class seriously, and put in effort on each assignment/exam,
as well as actively participate. Note that the participation component is a *qualitative*
score, based on the instructor's assessment of your overall participation in the course.

| item             | percentage    |
| -----------------|---------------|
| baseline grade   | 56%           |
| labs             | 23%           |
| homeworks        | 4.5%          |
| exam 1           | 4.5%          |
| exam 2           | 4.5%          |
| participation    | 7.5%          |

Late policy: late submissions are accepted up to 5 days after the deadline, with a
penalty of -20% per day applied.

Letter grades will be calculated based on the following intervals:

| range    | grade |
|----------|--------------|
| [93,100] | A |
| [90,93)  | A- |
| [87,90)  | B+ |
| [83,87)  | B |
| [80,83)  | B- |
| [77,80)  | C+ |
| [73,77)  | C |
| [70,73)  | C- |
| [67,70)  | D+ |
| [63,67)  | D |
| [60,63)  | D- |
| [0,60)   | F            |

## Attendance

Class attendance is not required, but is highly recommended
(see above info about Class Notes).

## Collaboration

We will use GitHub for collaboration. We will use private individual and team-specific
repositories to submit assignments. Your repositories will show up here:
[https://github.com/mines-csci400](https://github.com/mines-csci400)

## Respectfulness and Academic Honesty

Every student is expected to show respect to the instructors and the rest of the class. This course is preparation
for your future career, so make sure you are behaving with the same level of professionalism that
would be expected at a future full-time position. The general rule of thumb is:
**_informal_ is okay, but _disrespectful_ is not**.

- The instructor prefers to be addressed as "Sumner".
- It is vital that you do your best to participate in the class, and communicate with the instructor(s) about any course-related difficulties you are facing.

Plagiarism/cheating is NOT acceptable, and will be met with the maximum available penalty.
Sophisticated plagiarism-detection software will be used on every submitted assignment, and
all confirmed instances of cheating will be immediately reported to the Computer Science department.
Please ensure that you do not engage in or facilitate academic dishonesty in this class!

## Accommodation

The Colorado School of Mines is committed to ensuring the full participation of all students in its programs, including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. Students with disabilities may also wish to contact Disability Support Services (DSS) to discuss options to removing barriers in this course, including how to register and request official accommodations. Please visit their website at [https://disabilities.mines.edu](https://disabilities.mines.edu) for contact and additional information.  If you have already been approved for accommodations through DSS, please meet with me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

## Lab Topics

There will be 6 labs. Lab 1 will be individual, and Labs 2-6 will be completed in groups of 2-3 students.
You will have approximately **2 weeks** to work on each lab.
The labs build on each other, and lab solutions will NOT be provided, meaning you will need to pay
special attention to building a collection of **test cases**, to ensure that bugs in
earlier lab submissions do not propagate into later labs.

You will be given several test cases to check basic code functionality, but **you are responsible
for adding sufficient test cases to ensure that all corner cases have been covered**.
In most cases, you will also be able to use a "black-box" implementation such as the Node.js JavaScript
interpreter to compare with your implementation's behavior.
Buggy behavior will be identified by our own comprehensive set of test cases, and will result in lost points.
Programs which fail to compile will result in a 0 (zero) for the assignment -- no exceptions!
**You are responsible for ensuring that your code is properly submitted and properly compiling
using the toolchain discussed in class**.
